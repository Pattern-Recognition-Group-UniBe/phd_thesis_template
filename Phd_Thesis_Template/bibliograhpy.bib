	abstract     = {This paper presents a novel method to detect side-chain clusters in protein three-dimensional structures using a graph spectral approach. Protein side-chain interactions are represented by a labeled graph in which the nodes of the graph represent the Cβatoms and the edges represent the distance between the Cβatoms. The distance information and the non-bonded connectivity of the residues are represented in the form of a matrix called the Laplacian matrix. The constructed matrix is diagonalized and clustering information is obtained from the vector components associated with the second lowest eigenvalue and cluster centers are obtained from the vector components associated with the top eigenvalues. The method uses global information for clustering and a single numeric computation is required to detect clusters of interest. The approach has been adopted here to detect a variety of side-chain clusters and identify the residue which makes the largest number of interactions among the residues forming the cluster (cluster centers). Detecting such clusters and cluster centers are important from a protein structure and folding point of view. The crucial residues which are important in the folding pathway as determined by ΦFvalues (which is a measure of the effect of a mutation on the stability of the transition state of folding) as obtained from protein engineering methods, can be identified from the vector components corresponding to the top eigenvalues. Expanded clusters are detected near the active and binding site of the protein, supporting the nucleation condensation hypothesis for folding. The method is also shown to detect domains in protein structures and conserved side-chain clusters in topologically similar proteins.}

	abstract     = {Previous research on Facial Expression Recognition (FER) assisted by facial landmarks mainly focused on single-task learning or hard-parameter sharing based multi-task learning. However, soft-parameter sharing based methods have not been explored in this area. Therefore, this paper adopts Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) as the auxiliary task and explores new multi-task learning strategies for FER. First, three classical multi-task structures, including Hard-Parameter Sharing (HPS), Cross-Stitch Network (CSN), and Partially Shared Multi-task Convolutional Neural Network (PS-MCNN), are used to verify the advantages of multi-task learning for FER. Then, we propose a new end-to-end Co-attentive Multi-task Convolutional Neural Network (CMCNN), which is composed of the Channel Co-Attention Module (CCAM) and the Spatial Co-Attention Module (SCAM). Functionally, the CCAM generates the channel co-attention scores by capturing the inter-dependencies of different channels between FER and FLD tasks. The SCAM combines the max- and average-pooling operations to formulate the spatial co-attention scores. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four widely used benchmark facial expression databases, including RAF, SFEW2, CK+, and Oulu-CASIA. Extensive experimental results show that our approach achieves better performance than single-task and multi-task baselines, fully validating multi-task learning’s effectiveness and generalizability11Codes and detailed instructions will be available in github if our paper is accepted..},

Complex human behavior can be understood by studying physical features from multiple modalities; mainly facial, vocal and physical gestures. Recently, spontaneous multi-modal emotion recognition has been extensively studied for human behavior analysis. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning-based approach for audio-visual emotion recognition. Our approach leverages recent advances in deep learning like knowledge distillation and high-performing deep architectures. The deep feature representations of the audio and visual modalities are fused based on a model-level fusion strategy. A recurrent neural network is then used to capture the temporal dynamics. Our proposed approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in predicting valence on the RECOLA dataset. Moreover, our proposed visual facial expression feature extraction network outperforms state-of-the-art results on the AffectNet and Google Facial Expression Comparison datasets.}

	abstract     = {Signature forgery is at the centre of several fraudulent activities and legal battles. The introduction of 3D signatures, the virtual signing of ones name in the air, has the potential to restrict forgers due to the absence of visual cues that can be easily copied. Existing 3D signature recognition approaches, however, have not leveraged the inherent spatial and temporal information, making it difficult to handle the diminished separability and reproducibility of these signatures. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal adaptation of the Siamese Neural Network, wherein one branch extracts spatial features using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) while the other processes the input in the temporal domain using Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs). Unlike conventional deep learning networks, Siamese networks are an application of One-Shot Learning so as to learn from a small amount of data as is often the case in real life problems. They employ a distance metric that is forced to be small for like samples (signatures from the same person), and large for different samples (from different persons). The proposed approach, termed ST-SNN, is compared to other baseline classification architectures, and demonstrated using a publicly available biometric 3D signature benchmark dataset, yielding True Positive Rate (TPR) of 94.63\% with 4.1\% False Acceptance Rate (FAR).}

Indeed, the TGLSTM model jointly exploits structured data and temporal information through a deep neural network model able to learn long short-term dependencies together with graph structure. The experiments were made on popular datasets for action and gait recognition, MSR Action 3D, CAD-60, CASIA Gait B, “TUM Gait from Audio, Image and Depth” (TUM-GAID) datasets, investigating the advantages of TGLSTM with respect to state-of-the-art methods .}

Directed graphs have generally been treated as incidental to definitions on the more general class of undirected graphs. The implicit class imbalance in some graph problems also proves difficult to tackle. Moreover, a body of work has begun to grow that considers how to learn signals structured on the edges of graphs. In this paper, we propose the directed graph convolutional neural network (DGCNN), and describe a simple way to mitigate the inherent class imbalance in graphs. The model is applied to edge-structured signals from datacenter simulations using the structure of a directed linegraph to represent the second-order structure of its underlying graph. We demonstrate that the DGCNN’s improves over undirected models and other directed models by applying our model to locating link-faults in a datacenter simulation.}

	abstract     = {We address the problem of comparing deformable 3D objects represented by graphs such as triangular tessellations. We propose a new graph matching technique to measure the distance between these graphs. The proposed approach is based on a new decomposition of triangular tessellations into triangle-stars. The algorithm ensures a minimum number of disjoint triangle-stars, provides improved dissimilarity by covering larger neighbors and allows the creation of descriptors that are invariant or at least oblivious under the most common deformations. The present approach is based on an approximation of the Graph Edit Distance, which is fault-tolerant to noise and distortion, thus making our technique particularly suitable for the comparison of deformable objects. Classification is performed with supervised machine learning techniques. Our approach defines a metric space using graph embedding and graph kernel techniques. It is proved that the proposed distance is a pseudo-metric. Its time complexity is determined and the method is evaluated against benchmark databases. Our experimental results confirm the performances and the accuracy of our system.}

Dubbed ensemble learning by researchers in computational intelligence and machine learning, it is known to improve a decision systems robustness and accuracy. Now, fresh developments are allowing researchers to unleash the power of ensemble learning in an increasing range of real-world applications. Ensemble learning algorithms such as boosting and random forest facilitate solutions to key computational issues such as face recognition and are now being applied in areas as diverse as object tracking and bioinformatics. Responding to a shortage of literature dedicated to the topic, this volume offers comprehensive coverage of state-of-the-art ensemble learning techniques, including the random forest skeleton tracking algorithm in the Xbox Kinect sensor, which bypasses the need for game controllers. At once a solid theoretical study and a practical guide, the volume is a windfall for researchers and practitioners alike.}

It opens with descriptions and definitions of the various elements of protein structure and associated terminology. Following is an introduction into web-based structural bioinformatics that includes surveys of interactive web servers for protein fold or domain annotation, protein-structure databases, protein-structure-classification databases, structural alignments of proteins, and molecular graphics programs available for personal computers. The rest of the overview describes selected families of protein folds in terms of their secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structural arrangements, including ribbon-diagram examples, tables of representative structures with references, and brief explanations pointing out their respective biological and functional significance.},

	abstract     = {Ordinal classification of imbalanced data is a challenging problem that appears in many real world applications. The challenge is to simultaneously consider the order of the classes and the class imbalance, which can notably improve the performance metrics. The Bayesian formulation allows to deal with these two characteristics jointly: It takes into account the prior probability of each class and the decision costs, which can be used to include the imbalance and the ordinal information, respectively. We propose to use the Bayesian formulation to train neural networks, which have shown excellent results in many classification tasks. A loss function is proposed to train networks with a single neuron in the output layer and a threshold based decision rule. The loss is an estimate of the Bayesian classification cost, based on the Parzen windows estimator, which is fitted for a thresholded decision. Experiments with several real datasets show that the proposed method provides competitive results in different scenarios, due to its high flexibility to specify the relative importance of the errors in the classification of patterns of different classes, considering the order and independently of the probability of each class.}

	abstract     = {Regional dropout strategies have demonstrated to be very effective in improving both the performance and the generalization capability of deep learning models. However, when such strategies are performed in a totally random manner, the background noise and label mismatch problems arise. To tackle such problems, existing approaches typically focus on regions with the highest distinctiveness. Yet, there are two main drawbacks of existing approaches: (I) Many existing region-based augmentation methods can only use rectangular regions, resulting in the loss of object contour information; (II) Deterministic selection of the most discriminative regions leads to poor diversification in data augmentation. In fact, a trade-off is needed between diversification and concentration, which can decrease the undesirable noise. In this paper, we propose a novel object-centric contour-aware CutMix data augmentation strategy with arbitrary- shape and size superpixel supports, which is hereafter referred to as OcCaMix for short. It not only captures the most discriminative regions, but also effectively preserves the contour details of the objects. Moreover, it enables the search of natural object parts of different sizes. Extensive experiments on a large number of benchmark datasets show that OcCaMix significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CutMix based data augmentation methods in classification tasks.

abstract = {The role of infection and inflammation in the etiology of prostate cancer (PCa) is not entirely clear. Some evidence indicates that there are inflammatory lesions associated with PCa, which also correlate with prognosis. However, inflammation itself on biopsy does not always correlate with PCa. There are mechanisms to explain why inflammation could contribute to PCa, and some inflammatory genes that may be important. Evidence for specific inflammatory biomarkers is limited. The role of diet, and infection are not certain. The relationship of inflammation, and perhaps infection, likely involves inciting events in genetically susceptible people, influenced by their environment, to contribute to the development of PCa.}
