\textit{Pattern recognition} refers to the cognitive process that involves identifying and categorizing data to make sense of the environment. In essence, pattern recognition is a fundamental human ability, which is part of our intelligence and survival. We are constantly processing vast amounts of sensory data and identifying patterns that allow us to make predictions or informed decisions about the future. 

To name just a few examples, pattern recognition systems are able to solve various problems such as the recognition of facial expressions~\cite{siyue2019deep}, the temporal sorting of images~\cite{LORE2017650}, the enhancing of weakly lighted images~\cite{li2018lightennet}, situation recognition~\cite{jing2020relational}, or breast cancer detection~\cite{kahn19cancer}. 

Lorem ipsum dolor, nice intro, very good.

Maybe also add a cool overview graphic of your thesis, because pictures are best (see Figure~\ref{fig:overview_thesis} for a graphical overview).
